# SESMIC HAZARD DETECTION

A machine learning project for detecting and predicting seismic hazards using advanced data analysis techniques.

## Project Contents

- **database.csv** - Training and testing dataset containing seismic event data
- **ML_FINAL_PROJECT.ipynb** - Jupyter notebook with complete machine learning pipeline including:
  - Data exploration and preprocessing
  - Feature engineering
  - Model development and training
  - Evaluation and results

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- Required Python libraries (scikit-learn, pandas, numpy, matplotlib, etc.)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/DikshyPokhrel/SESMIC-HAZARD-DETECTION.git
cd SESMIC-HAZARD-DETECTION
```

2. Install required packages:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Open the Jupyter notebook:
```bash
jupyter notebook ML_FINAL_PROJECT.ipynb
```

## Usage

Run all cells in the notebook sequentially to:
1. Load and explore the seismic data
2. Preprocess and prepare the data
3. Train machine learning models
4. Evaluate model performance
5. Generate predictions and visualizations

## Dataset

The `database.csv` file contains seismic event records with various features used for hazard detection and prediction.

## Results

See the notebook for detailed results, visualizations, and model performance metrics.
